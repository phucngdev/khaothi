## Getting Started

To clone the Enosta React Restful codebase and get started, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the codebase.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://gitlab.enouvo.com/enosta/codebase/react-restful-vite-base
```

1. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the cloned directory:

```
cd react-restful-vite-base
```

1. Install the project dependencies using pnpm:

```
pnpm install
```

1. After the installation is finished, you can start the development server using the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server and you will be able to access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```
pnpm build
```

This will generate an optimized build of the application in the `build` directory.

Make sure you have pnpm installed on your system before running the above commands. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it globally by running:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

Now you're ready to clone the codebase, run the code, and build the Enosta React application using pnpm.
